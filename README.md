# AI Implementation in Legal Workflows: Training Case Study

## Disclaimer:
I have used gemini 3 flash to generate this readme file for convenience I will edit this later on. I also have read some links from the internet to make sure I understand the Legal AI system but primarily chose ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and research some legal AI used from Stanford Law School and UC Berkeley Law.

## Executive Summary
This repository serves as a professional portfolio and training environment for the implementation of Artificial Intelligence within legal drafting and client communication workflows. The project focuses on the strategic integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency while maintaining the highest standards of professional ethics, attorney-client privilege, and legal accuracy.

## Educational Framework
The contents of this repository are aligned with **Phase 1: AI Assistants for Legal Practice** of the *AI Tools for Legal Workflows* training program. 

### Module 1.1: Legal Correspondence & Document Drafting
The primary objective is to demonstrate competence in:
*   Generating professional legal correspondence with appropriate tone and formality.
*   Translating complex legal developments into client-accessible language.
*   Implementing rigorous quality control and verification protocols for AI-generated content.
*   Preserving attorney-client privilege within digital and AI-integrated environments.

## Case Scenario: GreenLeaf Cafe v. Apex Renovations Inc.
A comprehensive "Communication Suite" has been developed around a central hypothetical matter:
*   **Nature of Dispute:** Breach of contract and professional negligence in a commercial kitchen renovation.
*   **Client:** Ms. Sarah Chen, GreenLeaf Cafe.
*   **Opposing Party:** Apex Renovations Inc.
*   **Key Issues:** Contract delays, substantial revenue loss, and property damage resulting from faulty plumbing installation.

## Project Methodology
This project utilizes a structured **"Human-in-the-Loop"** methodology:
1.  **Strategic Prompt Engineering:** Designing specific, parameter-driven commands for the AI to ensure tone and factual alignment.
2.  **AI-Assisted Drafting:** Utilizing advanced LLMs (ChatGPT) to generate initial document structures.
3.  **Professional Refinement:** Manual review and editing of all outputs to correct "hallucinations," verify procedural accuracy, and adjust for professional nuances.
4.  **Verification Documentation:** Maintaining a clear record of prompts and refinement notes to ensure transparency and accountability.

    *   Internal Strategic Memoranda.

## Ethical Standards & Compliance
All workflows adhere to the **ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct**, with specific focus on:
*   **Rule 1.1 (Competence):** Maintaining technological competence in the use of AI.
*   **Rule 1.6 (Confidentiality):** Ensuring no real-world Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is processed through public AI tools.
*   **Rule 5.3 (Supervision):** Exercising independent professional judgment and oversight over non-human assistants.
