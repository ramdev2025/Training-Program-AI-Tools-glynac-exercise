       "## What Happens If There's a Dispute?\n",
       "\n",
       "If you have a problem or disagreement with the company about this agreement, it won't go to a regular court. Instead, the issue will be settled through a process called \"arbitration.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "## What is Arbitration?\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Arbitration** is like a private court that doesn't involve a judge or a jury. Instead, a neutral person called an \"arbitrator\" listens to both sides and makes a decision.\n",
       "- The decision from arbitration is final and binding, which means it must be followed just like a court order.\n",
       "\n",
       "## How Does Arbitration Work?\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Starting the Process**: \n",
       "   - You or the company can initiate arbitration if there's a dispute.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Who's In Charge?**:\n",
       "   - The **American Arbitration Association** will handle the process, following specific rules for commercial cases.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **No Jury**: \n",
       "   - During arbitration, you both give up the right to have a jury decide the matter. This means there's no traditional court trial.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Lawyer Costs**:\n",
       "   - If you win, you may get back reasonable lawyer fees and expenses. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **No Class Actions**: \n",
       "   - The agreement doesn’t allow for class actions, where a group of people brings a claim to arbitration together.\n",
       "\n",
       "## How Long Does It Take?\n",
       "\n",
       "The timeline can vary, but generally, arbitration can be quicker than a court trial. It often takes several months from start to finish. Here’s a basic timeline:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Filing and Response**: A formal complaint is made, and the other party responds. This can take a few weeks.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Selection of Arbitrator**: An arbitrator is chosen, usually within a month.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Hearing**: The arbitrator listens to both sides. This might be in person or via video.\n",
       "\n",
